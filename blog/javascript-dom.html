        <p class="post-content">
          Javascript, HTML and CSS can be described as building a house.
          <b>HTML</b> can be described as the structure or outline of a house,
          <b>CSS</b> is the decoration of the house and <b>Javascript</b> is
          compared to the utilities of a house, having interactivity with the

      <h1>Control flow and loops</h1>
      <div id="post">
        <p class="post-content">
          <b>Control flow</b> is the process of reading code that is written in
          order, however the order can be changed with the use of <b>if</b>,
          <b>else</b> or <b>else if</b>. This also applies to <b>loops</b> like
          for loops or while loops. Loops are used to repeat a function until a
          certain condition is met.

      <h1>DOM</h1>
      <div id="post">
        <p class="post-content">
          The <b>DOM</b> can be described as a detailed map of the elements on
          your webpage. When you want to make changes to your website, you use
          javascript to modify the <b>DOM</b>.

      <h1>Arrays and Objects</h1>
      <div id="post">
        <p class="post-content">
          <b>Arrays</b> and <b>Objects</b> are used to store different types of
          data. <b>Objects</b> primary use is for storing data within keys, when
          used it labels an identifier and to call back to it. <b>Arrays</b> are
          similar and easier to explain, when data is stored in an array, it
          uses an index number. In coding, the index number always starts from 0
          and counts up.

      <h1>Functions</h1>
      <div id="post">
        <p class="post-content">
          <b>Functions</b> are blocks of code used to perform a specific task.
          This avoids the necessity to rewrite code and it also requires the
          process of taking an input then outputting a result.
