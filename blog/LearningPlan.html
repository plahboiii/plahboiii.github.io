        My strength would be patience, being able to do tasks methodically
        rather than rushing. A few limitations I have would be my ability to
        communicate with others and lack of confidence in my own abilities.

        A few things I could do to commit to the programme would be, to stick to
        a routine and follow recommended times to finish the content provided to
        me by Dev Academy. When things start to build up, I'll actively seek
        help and turn to people that could provide help.
